# Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA vs. LSTM

This paper provides a theoretical introduction to the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. It compares the two models with respect to the minimization of their error rates and discusses successful applications of LSTM for time series forecasting. This paper summarizes the major findings of _A Comparison of ARIMA and LSTM in Forecasting Time Series_, which was presented at the 2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications.
